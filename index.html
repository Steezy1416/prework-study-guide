      <li>git status: Checks the current branch</li>
      <li>git checkout -b "branch name": Creates and new branch and switches to it</li>
      <li>Checkout command moves working branch to a new branch</li>
      <li>-b flag makes a new branch</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

      <h4>What is JavaScript?</h4>
      <li>JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
      <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
      <h4>Good to know</h4>
      <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
      <li>A method is a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.</li>
      <li>Arrays can hold a group of data and are most commonly used to store data that are related in some way.</li>
      <li>The location of something in an array is a unique number called an index, which always starts with a 0. For example num = [1,2,3,4], The index for 1 would be 0, 2 would be 1, 3 would be 2, and so on.</li>
      <li>A for loop consists of starting point by decalring a variable, conditon, and incrimenting the variable. </li>
      <li>Commenting on code lets you comment on the code without affecting it, and you can also comment out code when trying to find and fix a bug.</li>
      <li>A function is a set of instructions that tell the computer a set of instruction on how to perform a task. A function allows you do reuse code for example instead of manualy writing code to multiply numbers, if you make a function you can reuse the code but you would just have to call the function and update the parameters.</li>
