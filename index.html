      <h4>What is Css?</h4>
      <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
      <li>While Html is used to structure the webpage, Css is used to add style to the webpage and defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
      <h4>Types of Css</h4>
      <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using Css, Inline, Internal, and External</li>
      <li>Inline Css is used for specific Html tag. An example would be like coloring a single square with the number 1 red.</li>
      <li>Internal Css is used for a specific page and will apply to all elements in that page. An example would be like saying to color EVERY square with the number 1 red. </li>
      <li>External Css is when the css is in a separate file and you link the css to the html file. An example would be like making a branch and making changes in the branch and then mergin it with the repo.</li>
      <h4>Good to know</h4>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      <li>Css rule: footer {color: blue}... selector{property: value}. Inside the curly braces is called the declaration. </li>
      <li>To link external css to html: "link rel="stylesheet" href="where the file is located""</li>
      <li>rel: Specifies the relationship between a current document and the linked document resource.</li>
      <li>href: Speciies the location of the external soure. The location is derived from the current location.</li>
